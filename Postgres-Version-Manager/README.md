## PostgreSQL Version Manager for windows
The intended use of this project is for Continuous Integration (CI) scenarios, where:
- The PostgreSQL needs to be installed without user interaction and without admin rights.
- The PostgreSQL installation doesn't need to persist across multiple CI runs.

### Why
- Supports Windows 7 ... Windows 11, and Windows Server 2008 R2+ ... Windows Server 2025. Windows on ARM64 is also supported.
- Does not need additional dependencies. Supports Powershell 2.0+ or any Powershell Core (pwsh)
- Optionally installs corresponding MS VC Rintime depending on version if not preinstalled.
- Two distributions: full and tiny. Tiny is 20x smaller download size
- Two Configuration options: as user process, or as windows service. The first does not need additional priviedges
- Client side download failover using two CDNs: official and mirror on sourceforge.
- Reuses the force of aria2c multithreaded download speed. For very old windows without TLS 1.2 support aria2c is required.
